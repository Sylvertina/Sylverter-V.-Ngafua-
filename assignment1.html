    <h2>Subject of study</h2>
    <p>
At the Startz University,we have a pretty open-minded reseach facility-- as long the subject fall somewhere in the realm
of science snd technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated reseacher;and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigue by are as follows,in order of priority
<br>Turning H<sub>2</sub> O into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayer at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F),
when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3*10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3*10<sup>4</sup>)
    </p>
    <p>
        <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>
        constructs for representing musical scores. <br>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subject, including how long you'd expect the reseach to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Exotic dance move</h2>
    <p>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,i did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question, my favouritedance are as follows,with definitions: <br>
    Polynesian chicken dancebr
    <br>
    A little know but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestockto be 
    "fruitful".
    <br><br>
    Arctic robot dance
    An intersting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic"
    stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants of Norhtern Alaska and Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
