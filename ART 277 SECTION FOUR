                <p><b>Re: Albert Momo University Application</b></p><hr><p></p><p>Dear Mr. Momo</p><p>Thank you for recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year.<br>I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections</p>
            <p><b>Starting dates</b><br><br>We are happy to accommodate you staring your study with us at any time,however it would suit <br>us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as<br>follows :</p><p>First semester:9 October 2022<br>Second semester:15 January 2023<br>Third semester:2 May 2023</p><p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer</p><p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website</p>

            <p><b>Subjects of study</b></p><p>At the Starz University,we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.<br> You seem like an intelligent, dedicated reseacher,and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: </p><p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3.)</sub><br>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayer at temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F),<br>when the audience size exponentialy increase (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup></p>
            <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
            <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects ,including how long you'd <br>except the reseach to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
            <p></p><h2><b>Exotic dance moves</b></h2><p></p>
            <p>Yes , you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, Idid study exotic tribal  dances.To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows,with definition:<br>
         </p><p>
            Polynesian chicken dance
            </p><div style="padding-left: 55px;">
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock to be "friutful"<div>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <div style="padding-left: 55px;">
            <!-- needs to be indented -->
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impereptibly tiny, very rapid movements.<br>One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</div>
         Arctic robot dance
            <div style="padding-left: 55px;">
                <!-- needs to be indented -->
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960<sub>s</sub><br>believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic",stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Lateron however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</div>
        <p></p>

    <p>Youra sincerely,</p>
